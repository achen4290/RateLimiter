"""
Intended use case:
    - You have multiple endpoints that should be rate-limited at different rates and/or separately. 
    - Each user who uses your endpoints has some kind of ID that you can use to impose rate limits on a per-user basis
    - Every user has the exact same rate limit.

1. Initialize endpoints that should be rate-limited in a RateLimiter object using create_events
2. Every time a user uses your endpoint, call valid_call to determine if that user is requesting beyond their rate limit
    - If true, the user is requesting within the limit specified by create_event for that endpoint
    - If false, the user is requesting beyond the limit specified by create_event for that endpoint
